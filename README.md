This is base image built on top of Ubuntu 14.

The image contains installed Firefox 32 and its dependencies.

This image does not have CMD instruction.

It will be used as based for a container which will run Firefox + necessary services and drivers for using smart cards.

The version of Firefox is 32 because in version 33 it is not possible to digitally sign.
